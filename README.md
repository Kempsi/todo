- Started originally 14.5.2024, but after taking a bit too big of a leap, decided to start over vith V2.

- 18.5.2024, made a new version called"todoV2".
- Project finished around end of july 24.

User can add, update and delete tasks. Tasks have different categories and statuses.
Tasks also have deadlines and can be favourited.

"todo" is ran with a local database, the one I used was MariaDB with HeidiSQL.
Connection string is local and very generic and most likely not the right way to do it :D

*UPDATE 5.10.2024 - Learned how to hide and encrypt connection string in a config file, even though it's public in commit history. Oh well.

Source code for the project was a mix of old knowledge and new. A lot of experimenting with AI recommended code 
and tips. Some of it even was straight up copied over, because I did not understand the concept,
but somehow made it work and some of it I still don't crasp fully.

Learnt alot over time and will take this knowledge to other projects in the future.
