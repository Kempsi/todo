# todo
To do list app, version 2


- Started originally 14.5.2024, but after taking a bit too big of a leap, decided to start over vith V2.

- 18.5.2024, made a new version called"todoV2".
- Project finished around end of july 24.

"todo" is ran with a local database, the one I used was MariaDB with HeidiSQL.
Connection string is local and very generic and most likely not the right way to do it :D

Source code for the project was a mix of old knowledge and new. A lot of experimenting with AI recommended code 
and tips. Some of it even was straight up copied over, because I did not understand the concept,
but somehow made it work and some of it I still don't crasp fully.

Learnt alot over time and will take this knowledge to other projects in the future.
